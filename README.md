# Burger App
A Fulcro Sample project based on the Burger app from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux
The original is done in React and I am building the same with Fulcro as a learning exercise.

## install
```shell script
npm install react react-dom shadow-cljs
```

```shell script
npx shadow-cljs server
```

Browse to http://localhost:9630/ for the build server and
http://localhost:8000/ for the actual web page.
